Notes:
1. Use Gehrkin/Cucumber BDD style to write the framework.
2. Run it across Chrome and Safari
3. Implement parallel execution.
4. Source and destination should be parameterized.

  When I open client website with "<browser>"
  Then I can see the published article with "<browser>"

Examples:
 | browser  |
 | Chrome   |
 | Safari   | 

3. Implement parallel execution

Feature: Refund item

  Rule Outline: verify functionA() on page type <type>

    Scenario Outline: functionA() is called on page type <type> -- No errors
      Given I load the site and go to a <type> page
      Then I should see no errors are thrown

    Scenario Outline: functionA() is called on page type <type> -- Minimal delay
      Given I load the site and go to a <type> page
      Then there is a minimal delay before calling functionA()

    Scenario Outline: functionA() is called -- correct type <type>
      Given I load the site and go to a <type> page
      Then the page type is <type>

  ...many more tests using an identical Examples array

    Examples:
      | type |
      | "product" |
